Ramonify — Personal Finance Dashboard
Ramonify is a data-driven personal finance dashboard designed to help students understand their spending patterns through accessible visualizations and plain-language insights. Built with machine learning and interactive data analysis, Ramonify empowers users to make informed financial decisions and plan for their financial future.
Overview
Users can upload a transaction-level CSV file to:

Analyze monthly income, expenses, and net cash flow with interactive charts
Identify top spending categories by month
Receive personalized, plain-English budgeting tips
Get automated overspending warnings based on historical patterns
Simulate "what-if" budget scenarios to test different spending strategies
View machine learning-powered forecasts of next month's cash flow
Automatically categorize uncategorized transactions using ML
Download summarized data for further analysis

This project focuses on financial literacy, accessibility, and practical insights, especially for first-generation college students and underserved populations who may lack access to traditional financial planning tools.
Features
Machine Learning Auto-Categorization
Ramonify includes a trained classifier that automatically categorizes uncategorized transactions based on merchant names. The system uses TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression to achieve high accuracy, learning from your existing categorized transactions to predict categories for new entries.
Interactive Data Visualizations
Built with Plotly, the dashboard provides interactive charts that allow users to:

Zoom and pan through their financial history
Hover over data points for detailed information
View dual-panel visualizations showing both net cash flow and income vs. expenses
See forecast predictions with color-coded markers

Scenario Simulation
Users can test different budget strategies by adjusting spending in top categories and adding potential income sources. The system recalculates forecasts in real-time, showing the financial impact of proposed changes before committing to them.
Intelligent Warnings
The dashboard analyzes spending patterns and provides context-aware warnings when spending exceeds historical averages by a user-defined threshold, helping prevent financial shortfalls.

Key Algorithms
Forecasting

Rolling Average: 3-month moving average of net cash flow for short-term prediction
Linear Regression: Trend-based forecasting using historical patterns

Categorization

Feature Extraction: TF-IDF vectorization of merchant names with bigram support
Classification: Multi-class logistic regression with 1000 max iterations
Validation: Train-test split with accuracy reporting

Scenario Simulation

Impact Calculation: Percentage-based adjustments to top spending categories
Forecast Adjustment: Real-time recalculation of predicted cash flow based on user inputs

Design Philosophy
Ramonify is built with the following principles:
Accessibility First: Plain-language explanations replace financial jargon. Insights are actionable and easy to understand for users with limited financial literacy.
Student-Focused: Designed specifically for college students and young adults who are managing their finances independently for the first time.
Privacy-Conscious: All data processing happens locally. Transaction data is never stored or transmitted to external servers.
Actionable Insights: Every warning and tip includes specific, practical recommendations that users can implement immediately.
Future Enhancements
Potential features for future development:

Integration with bank APIs for automatic transaction import
Multi-currency support for international students
Recurring transaction detection and subscription tracking
Peer comparison benchmarks (anonymized aggregate data)
Mobile-responsive interface for on-the-go access
Export to PDF reports for financial aid offices
Goal tracking with progress visualization
Savings recommendations based on spending patterns
